# LB1-Kunitz-HMM

The goal of this project was to generate a reliable hmm classifier for the presence of the Kunitz domain in a protein sequence (based on a multiple sequence alignment), and classify the entire SwissProt dataset. 

Two models were generated and for each one, the datasets used for the training and the evaluation, as well as the performance scores, are available in the respective directory. 

The python script was used for the final evaluation and visualization of the performance of the models.
